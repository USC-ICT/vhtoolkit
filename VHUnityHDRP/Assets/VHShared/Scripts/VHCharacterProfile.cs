        "specific features, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio-visual" +
        " sensing, all in real-time. The Toolkit was originally released in 2009 as a collection of" +
        " modules, tools, and libraries designed to aid and support researchers and developers with the" +
        " creation of virtual human conversational characters. The current iteration of the Virtual" +
        " Human Toolkit is built with RIDE.\r\nRapid Integration & Development Environment (RIDE) is a " +
        "research and development rapid prototyping testbed using real-time 3D game engines. It " +
        "primarily targets the Unity game engine, with early support for Unreal Engine. RIDE has a " +
        "vendor-agnostic API that allows porting to other engines, including VBS4.\r\nRIDE is a collaboration" +
        " between many groups at ICT. RIDE integration is headed up by Arno Hartholt, Ed Fast, and Sharon" +
        " Mozgai. RIDE is developed at USC ICT, sponsored by the U.S. Army DEVCOM Soldier Center STTC, ARO," +
        " the Navy, and others. The Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) is a University Affiliated" +
        " Research Center (UARC) and as such a trusted partner with the DoD. ICT is part of the University" +
        " of Southern California (USC) Viterbi School of Engineering. ICT was founded in 1994, so we are" +
        " celebrating our 25th anniversary!\r\nRIDE is available for the academic and military S&T" +
        " communities, including source code. It provides integrated modules and tools to rapidly " +
        "develop simulation prototypes. RIDE includes One World Terrain (OWT), machine learning interfaces," +
        " cloud AI interfaces, agent behavior scripting tools, and virtual humans.\r\nVirtual humans are" +
        " embodied conversational agents that use speech recognition, natural language processing," +
        " audio-visual sensing, text-to-speech generation, and nonverbal behavior generation and realization." +
